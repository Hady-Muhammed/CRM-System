# CRMSystem

A CRM pipeline is a visual representation of the sales process, divided into multiple 
stages. Each stage represents a particular step in the process, such as Lead, Contacted, 
Qualified, Proposal, Closed Won, and Closed Lost. A CRM pipeline allows sales teams to 
track and manage their leads and opportunities more efficiently
